  <p>We hope you enjoy your experience. We will put you in contact with your hosts once you are paired up.</p>
   <p>Expect to be asked what you can contribute to the meal, whether it is a side dish, devar torah or desert, as your hosts are likely contributing a great deal towards your meal.</p>
  
  
  <p>While we trust that you are a upstanding citizen of our wonderful community,
we want to remind you that we are here to promote a positive and warm environment in our community, and these experiences are meant to bring us together, not to divide us. Therefore, we would strongly insist on stellar behavior and etiquette. </p>
